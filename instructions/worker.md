# Create your own completion file
touch ./tmp/worker1_done.txt  # for worker1
# touch ./tmp/worker2_done.txt  # for worker2
# touch ./tmp/worker3_done.txt  # for worker3

# Check if all workers are done
if [ -f ./tmp/worker1_done.txt ] && [ -f ./tmp/worker2_done.txt ] && [ -f ./tmp/worker3_done.txt ]; then
    echo "All workers completed. Reporting as the final completer."
    ./agent-send.sh boss1 "All tasks completed."
